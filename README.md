For most of the function, there was a lot of trial and error involved.
For each function, I thought about the best way to approach it, and then began coding.
None of the functions were difficult enough for me to warrant writing pseudocode,
but I did end up thinking more about some functions than others.
I found the TA's very helpful in fully completing this lab, especially on those
where I got somewhat stuck. Overall, it was a good final lab for CSCI 102.

Some Specifics on Each Function
Function 1 was copied from a previously submitted lab.
Function 2 involves the code used for opening and reading files.
Function 3 used a for loop to place the correction letter at the desired index.
Function 4 relys on functions 1 and 2 and otherwise just loops through.
Function 5, 6, and 7 are very similar. They both loop through all lists but depending
on the desired output they run different codes as they loop.
